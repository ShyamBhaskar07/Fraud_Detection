# Data Cleaning:
    1. Duplicates
    2. Missing Values
    3. Outliers
    4. Inconsisitency
All the above steps have perfomed on the dataset.

In Fraud Detection, most of the frauds will come under outliers, So it's not a good idea to remove them blindly. 
So We analyzed outliers based on numeric attributes to find which attribute contributes more for Fraud Detection.

We have conducted an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset, analyzing the transaction amount, balance, and time of fraud.

# Modelling:
    1. Linear Regression Model with accuracy 95.52%
    2. Logistic Regression Model with accuracy 97.85% (ensuring the model is not over-fitting)
